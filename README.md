## A note to everyone who want to self host this bot

The developer team does not support the idea of self hosting this bot. We love to help other developers to get their bot online with the same quality as ours however self-hosting is something we won't be supporting anytime soon. In the past we've had multiple indicents with fake versions of Stereo by people who either said that they were the original creator (or in other words saying they were DaanGamesDG) or said that they built the bot by themselves from scratch which indicated that they broke the self-hosting rules.

The main reason why we want to keep our code open-source is to help beginning developers/small dev groups who are building a same sort of bot by showing them how certain functions (like dashboard) are written. It allows them to search through and even copy a few lines of code to use in their own project so that they don't have to re-invent the wheel. Don't forget that if you are ever thinking of using one or two lines of code from this project, please make sure to understand what it does. Otherwise it will be hard for you and other contributors to work with that code you copied which may ruin your project.

Having said all this, it is also worth noting that Spyro will in no way be capable of running on services such as [Glitch] or [Heroku]. A VPS (Virtual Private Server) or a decided computer you have laying around is required in order to keep the bot running without breaking everytime/slowing down on processes.
